# Sorting Algorithms Visualization

This project is a Python application that visualizes various sorting algorithms using Pygame. It aims to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work through step-by-step execution and visualization of the sorting process.

## Features

- Visualize different sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Shaker Sort
- Control sorting execution with interactive buttons:
  - Start/Resume sorting
  - Step through the algorithm
  - Undo the last step
- Sound effects to enhance interaction

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Pygame
- Pygame mixer for sound functionality

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SharonMelanker/Sorting-visualization.git
   cd Sorting-visualization
